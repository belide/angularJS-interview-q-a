Angular JS Interview Questions &amp; Answer

###1) What are the advantage of AngularJS?

There are following advantages of AngularJS:
* Data Binding 
* Customize & Extensible 
* Code Reusability 
* Compatibility 
		
###2) What is the role of ng-app, ng-init and ng-model directives?

  ng-app - Initialize the angular app.
	ng-init - Initialize the angular app data.
	ng-model - Bind the html elem

###3) What is $scope and $rootScope?
	$scope - A $scope is a JavaScript object which is used for communication between controller and view. 
			Basically, $scope binds a view (DOM element) to the model and functions defined in a controller.

	$rootScope - The $rootScope is the top-most scope. An app can have only one $rootScope which will be shared among
	all the components of an app. Hence it acts like a global variable. All other $scopes are children of the $rootScope. 
  
###4) What are the directives in angular JS ?
	AngularJS directives are a combination of AngularJS template markups (HTML attributes or elements, or CSS classes) 
	and supporting JavaScript code.The JavaScript directive code defines the template data and behaviors of the HTML elements.

###5) What are different ways to invoke a directive?
	Attribute ('A')		<span my-directive></span>
	Class('C') 		<span class="my-directive: expression;"></span>
	Element ('E')	 	<my-directive></my-directive>
	Comment	('M')		<!-- directive: my-directive expression -->

###6) What is difference between $scope and scope ?
	$scope - In case of DI, you inject the scope object with the dollar prefix i.e. $scope. The reason is the injected arguments must match to the names of injectable objects followed by dollar ($) prefix .
	scope - When the methods like directive linker function donâ€™t receive arguments through dependency injection, you just pass the scope 		object without using dollar prefix i.e. scope. The reason is the passing arguments are received by its caller.

  
###7) What is difference between services and factory ?
	Service - It is just a function for the business layer of the application . It is act as a constauctor function and invoked 
	once at a run time with new keyword.
	factory - Factory give you the same capability of as .serice() , but it is more powerful and flexible . A factory is a design 		pattern . Factory create objetcs such as new class instances , returns object literals, return functions and closures or even just return a simply string.
